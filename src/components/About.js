            <p>I am a specialized frontend developer and UX/UI designer with a user centered approach and a unique perspective when it comes to design, due to my background in Architecture and Graphic Design.
                This approach allows me to not only value and contribute on the success of the business but also connect to its users in a meaningful way.
